           1. Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).<br> 
           2. Beat butter, white sugar, and brown sugar with an electric mixer in a large bowl until smooth. Beat in eggs, one at a time, then stir in vanilla. Dissolve baking soda in hot water. Add to batter along with salt. Stir in flour, chocolate chips, and walnuts. <br> 
           3. Drop spoonfuls of dough 2 inches apart onto ungreased baking sheets. <br> 
           4. Bake in the preheated oven until edges are nicely browned, about 10 minutes. Cool on the baking sheets briefly before removing to a wire rack to cool completely.<br>
